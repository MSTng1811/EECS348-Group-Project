Made sure the back end and front end development of the code was bridged together and finished any loose ends with the projectAttendance: Mark Maloney, Ty Farrington, Brett Suhr, Aiden Burke (Muskan Sharma couldn’t make it but her part was completed)Meeting Notes #6Today, Mark organized a zoom meeting with Ty, Brett, and Aidan at 3pm. We discussed previous development of the document. Ty was able to connect the front end html file to the c++ files on the backend using a JavaScript server hosted locally. Brett and Aidan made sure that the errors were hammered out with the backend. Ty and Brett went through the test cases and updated it into the test case document. Mark continued to add advanced features to the front end including buttons and made it more visually appealing. After making sure the code development was in order, Aidan pushed the changes to github. While that was happening Mark continued updating the User Manual document. Then we all starting looking over the user manual document and added examples of our project to the document. Once that was done, we deemed the project complete to the best of our abilities. Ty will be responsible for emailing everyone a copy of the notes for the meeting.Team Name: Cryptic CodersTeam Roles:1.
